  abstract     =  "Simultaneous X-ray and optical observations of black
                  hole X-ray binaries have shown that the light curves 
                  contain multiple correlated and anti-correlated 
	              variation components when the objects are in the 
	              hard state. In the case of the black hole X-ray 
	              binary, {GX} 339-4, the cross correlation function
	              ({CCF}) of the light curves suggests a positive 
	              correlation with an optical lag of 0.15 s and
	              anti-correlations with an optical lag of 1 s and 
	              X-ray lag of 4 s. This indicates the two light curves
	              have some common signal components with different 
	              delays. In this study, we extracted and reconstructed 
	              those signal components from the data for {GX} 339-4. 
	              The results confirmed that correlation and anti-correlation 
	              with the optical lag are two common components. However, we 
	              found that the reconstructed light curve for the 
	              anti-correlated component indicates a positively correlated 
	              variation with an X-ray lag of {\textasciitilde} +1 s. In
	              addition, the {CCF} for this signal component shows 
	              anti-correlations not only with the optical lag,
	              but also with the X-ray lag, which is consistent with the 
	              {CCF} for the data. Therefore, our results suggest that 
	              the combination of the two positively correlated 
	              components, that is, the X-ray preceding signal with
	              the 0.15-s optical lag and the optical preceding signal with
	              the 1-s X-ray lag, can make the observed {CCF} without
	              anti-correlated signals. The optical preceding signal may
	              be caused by synchrotron emission in a magnetically dominated 
	              accretion flow or in a jet, while further study
	              is required to understand the mechanism of the X-ray time lag.",

                  generative adversarial networks ({GANs}) to reduce
                  noise in weak lensing mass maps under realistic
                  conditions. We apply image-to-image translation
                  using conditional {GANs} to the mass map obtained
                  from the first-year data of Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam
                  ({HSC}) survey. We train the conditional {GANs} by
                  using 25000 mock {HSC} catalogues that directly
                  incorporate a variety of observational effects. We
                  study the non-Gaussian information in denoised maps
                  using one-point probability distribution functions
                  ({PDFs}) and also perform matching analysis for
                  positive peaks and massive clusters. An ensemble
                  learning technique with our {GANs} is successfully
                  applied to reproduce the {PDFs} of the lensing
                  convergence. About $60\%$ of
                  the peaks in the denoised maps with height greater
                  than 5$\sigma$ have counterparts of massive clusters
                  within a separation of 6 arcmin. We show that {PDFs}
                  in the denoised maps are not compromised by details
                  of multiplicative biases and photometric redshift
                  distributions, nor by shape measurement errors, and
                  that the {PDFs} show stronger cosmological
                  dependence compared to the noisy counterpart. We
                  apply our denoising method to a part of the
                  first-year {HSC} data to show that the observed mass
                  distribution is statistically consistent with the
                  prediction from the standard $\Lambda${CDM} model."

  abstract     =  "Blazars can be divided into two subtypes, flat
                  spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lac objects,
                  which have been distinguished phenomenologically by
                  the strength of their optical emission lines, while
                  their physical nature and relationship are still not
                  fully understood. In this paper, we focus on the
                  differences in their variability. We characterize
                  the blazar variability using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
                  (OU) process, and investigate the features that are
                  discriminative for the two subtypes. We used optical
                  photometric and polarimetric data obtained with the
                  1.5-m Kanata telescope for 2008-2014. We found that
                  four features, namely the variation amplitude,
                  characteristic timescale, and non-stationarity of
                  the variability obtained from the light curves and
                  the median of the degree of polarization (PD), are
                  essential for distinguishing between FSRQs and BL
                  Lac objects. FSRQs are characterized by rare and
                  large flares, while the variability of BL Lac
                  objects can be reproduced with a stationary OU
                  process with relatively small amplitudes. The
                  characteristics of the variability are governed not
                  by the differences in the jet structure between the
                  subtypes, but by the peak frequency of the
                  synchrotron emission. This implies that the nature
                  of the variation in the jets is common in FSRQs and
                  BL Lac objects. We found that BL Lac objects tend to
                  have high PD medians, which suggests that they have
                  a stable polarization component. FSRQs have no such
                  component, possibly because of a strong Compton
                  cooling effect in sub-pc scale jets."

                  search for the mutual alignment of the disk
                  axes. Specifically, we apply the Kuiper test to
                  examine the statistical uniformity of the position
                  angle (PA: the angle of the major axis of the
                  projected disk ellipse measured counterclockwise
                  from the north) distribution. The disks located in
                  the star-forming regions, except the Lupus clouds,
                  do not show any signature of the alignment,
                  supporting the random orientation. Rotational axes
                  of 16 disks with spectroscopic measurement of PA in
                  the Lupus III cloud, a subregion of the Lupus field,
                  however, exhibit a weak and possible departure from
                  the random distribution at a 2$\sigma$ level, and
                  the inclination angles of the 16 disks are not
                  uniform as well. Furthermore, the mean direction of
                  the disk PAs in the Lupus III cloud is parallel to
                  the direction of its filament structure and
                  approximately perpendicular to the magnetic field
                  direction. We also confirm the robustness of the
                  estimated PAs in the Lupus clouds by comparing the
                  different observations and estimators based on three
                  different methods, including sparse modeling. The
                  absence of the significant alignment of the disk
                  orientation is consistent with the turbulent origin
                  of the disk angular momentum. Further observations
                  are required to confirm/falsify the possible disk
                  alignment in the Lupus III cloud."

                  meteors are important to understand the size
                  distribution of the interplanetary dust. However,
                  faint meteors detected by high power large aperture
                  radar observations, which are typically as faint as
                  10 mag. In optical, have not been detected until
                  recently in optical observations, mainly due to
                  insufficient sensitivity of the optical
                  observations. In this paper, two radar and optical
                  simultaneous observations were organized. The first
                  observation was carried out in 2009-2010 using
                  Middle and Upper Atmosphere Radar (MU radar) and an
                  image-intensified CCD camera. The second observation
                  was carried out in 2018 using the MU radar and a
                  mosaic CMOS camera, Tomo-e Gozen, mounted on the
                  1.05-m Kiso Schmidt Telescope. In total, 331
                  simultaneous meteors were detected. The relationship
                  between radar cross sections and optical V-band
                  magnitudes was well approximated by a linear
                  function. A transformation function from the radar
                  cross section to the V-band magnitude was derived
                  for sporadic meteors. The transformation function
                  was applied to about 150,000 meteors detected by the
                  MU radar in 2009-2015, large part of which are
                  sporadic, and a luminosity function was derived in
                  the magnitude range of -1.5--9.5mag . The luminosity
                  function was well approximated by a single power-law
                  function with the population index of
                  $r=3.52\pm 0.12$. The present observation indicates that
                  the MU radar has capability to detect interplanetary
                  dust of $10^{-5}$ -- $10^0$g in mass as meteors."

                  (SpM) is applied for the first time to observational
                  data sets taken by the Atacama Large
                  Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The two data
                  sets used in this study were taken independently
                  using different array configurations at Band 7 (330
                  GHz), targeting the protoplanetary disk around HD

                  image resolutions reconstructed from the two data
                  sets are different by a factor of $\sim$3. We confirm
                  that the previously known disk structures appear on
                  the images produced by both SpM and CLEAN at the
                  standard beam size. The image reconstructed from the
                  shorter-baseline data using the SpM matches that
                  obtained with the longer-baseline data using the
                  CLEAN, achieving a super-resolution image from which
                  a structure finer than the beam size can be
                  reproduced. Our results demonstrate that ongoing
                  intensive development in the SpM imaging technique
                  is beneficial to imaging with ALMA."

                  (SiPex), to resolve overlapping signals by a
                  combination of amino-acid selective isotope labeling
                  (AASIL) and tensor decomposition. The basic idea of
                  Sipex is that overlapping signals can be decomposed
                  with the help of intensity patterns derived from
                  quantitative fractional AASIL, which also provides
                  amino-acid information. In SiPex, spectra for
                  protein characterization, such as 15N relaxation
                  measurements, are assembled with those for
                  amino-acid information to form a four-order tensor,
                  where the intensity patterns from AASIL contribute
                  to high decomposition performance even if the
                  signals share similar chemical shift values or
                  characterization profiles, such as relaxation
                  curves. The loading vectors of each decomposed
                  component, corresponding to an amide group,
                  represent both the amino-acid and relaxation
                  information. This information link provides an
                  alternative protein analysis method that does not
                  require ``assignments'' in a general sense; i.e.,
                  chemical shift determinations, since the amino-acid
                  information for some of the residues allows
                  unambiguous assignment according to the dual
                  selective labeling. SiPex can also decompose signals
                  in time-domain raw data without Fourier transform,
                  even in non-uniformly sampled data without spectral
                  reconstruction. These features of SiPex should
                  expand biological NMR applications by overcoming
                  their overlapping and assignment problems.",

  abstract =     "Imaging observations of faint meteors were carried
                  out on April 11 and 14, 2016 with a wide-field CMOS
                  mosaic camera, Tomo-e PM, mounted on the 105-cm
                  Schmidt telescope at Kiso Observatory, the
                  University of Tokyo. Tomo-e PM, which is a prototype
                  model of Tomo-e Gozen, can monitor a sky of
                  $\sim$1.98$\sim$deg$^2$ at 2Hz. The numbers of detected
                  meteors are 1514 and 706 on April 11 and 14,
                  respectively. The detected meteors are attributed to
                  sporadic meteors. Their absolute magnitudes range
                  from +4 to +10mag in the V-band, corresponding to
                  about $8.3{\times}10^{-2}$ to
                  $3.3{\times}10^{-4}$g in mass. The present
                  magnitude distributions we obtained are well
                  explained by a single power-law luminosity function
                  with a slope parameter $r=3.1\pm 0.4$ and a meteor
                  rate $\log_{10}N0=-5.5\pm 0.5$. The results
                  demonstrate a high performance of telescopic
                  observations with a wide-field video camera to
                  constrain the luminosity function of faint
                  meteors. The performance of Tomo-e Gozenis about two
                  times higher than that of Tomo-e PM. A survey with
                  Tomo-e Gozenwill provide a more robust measurement
                  of the luminosity function."

                  interferometry using sparse modeling, utilizing two
                  regularization terms: the $\ell_1$-norm and a new
                  function named total squared variation (TSV) of the
                  brightness distribution. First, we demonstrate that
                  our technique may achieve a superresolution of
                  $\sim30\%$ compared with the traditional CLEAN beam
                  size using synthetic observations of two point
                  sources. Second, we present simulated observations
                  of three physically motivated static models of Sgr
                  A$^\ast$ with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) to
                  show the performance of proposed techniques in
                  greater detail. Remarkably, in both the image and
                  gradient domains, the optimal beam size minimizing
                  root-mean-squared errors is $\le 10\%$ of the
                  traditional CLEAN beam size for $\ell_1+$ TSV
                  regularization, and non-convolved reconstructed
                  images have smaller errors than beam-convolved
                  reconstructed images. This indicates that TSV is
                  well matched to the expected physical properties of
                  the astronomical images and the traditional
                  post-processing technique of Gaussian convolution in
                  interferometric imaging may not be required. We also
                  propose a feature-extraction method to detect
                  circular features from the image of a black hole
                  shadow and use it to evaluate the performance of the
                  image reconstruction. With this method and
                  reconstructed images, the EHT can constrain the
                  radius of the black hole shadow with an accuracy of
                  $\sim10\% - 20\%$ in present simulations for Sgr
                  A$^\ast$, suggesting that the EHT would be able to
                  provide useful independent measurements of the mass
                  of the supermassive black holes in Sgr A$^\ast$ and

                  mirror have conventionally been used in ground-based
                  mid-infrared observations. However, it is not
                  practical for next generation large telescopes to
                  have a large tip-tilt mirror that moves at a
                  frequency larger than a few hertz. We propose an
                  alternative observing method, a ``slow-scanning''
                  observation. Images are continuously captured as
                  movie data, while the field of view is slowly
                  moved. The signal from an astronomical object is
                  extracted from the movie data by a low-rank and
                  sparse matrix decomposition. The performance of the
                  ``slow-scanning'' observation was tested in an
                  experimental observation with Subaru/COMICS. The
                  quality of a resultant image in the ``slow-scanning''
                  observation was as good as in a conventional
                  chopping observation with COMICS, at least for a
                  bright point-source object. The observational
                  efficiency in the ``slow-scanning'' observation was
                  better than that in the chopping observation. The
                  results suggest that the ``slow-scanning'' observation
                  can be a competitive method for the Subaru telescope
                  and be of potential interest to other ground-based
                  facilities to avoid chopping.",

                  expected to create a new field of astronomy,
                  so-called ``movie astronomy,'' in the near
                  future. The amount of data from the observations
                  will be huge, and hence efficient data compression
                  will be indispensable. Here we propose a low-rank
                  matrix approximation with sparse matrix
                  decomposition as a promising solution to reduce the
                  data size effectively while preserving sufficient
                  scientific information. We apply one of the methods
                  to the movie data obtained with the prototype model
                  of the Tomo-e Gozen mounted on the 1.0 m Schmidt
                  telescope of Kiso Observatory. Once full-scale
                  observation with the Tomo-e Gozen commences, it will
                  generate ~30 TB of data per night. We demonstrate
                  that the data are compressed by a factor of about 10
                  in size without losing transient events like optical
                  short transient point sources and meteors. The
                  intensity of point sources can be recovered from the
                  compressed data. The processing runs sufficiently

                  movements effortlessly. The problem seems difficult
                  since there are infinitely many possible
                  trajectories and our musculo-skeltal system is
                  generally redundant. We focus on the motor command
                  representation and show that a simple strategy can
                  solve the problem for a planar two-joints arm
                  model. We also discuss the emergence of the muscle
                  synergies, which may enable us to make natural motor
                  behaviors with smaller degrees of freedom.",

  abstract =     "The information transfer through a single neuron is a
                  fundamental information processing in the
                  brain. This paper studies the information-theoretic
                  capacity of a single neuron by treating the neuron
                  as a communication channel. Two different models are
                  considered. The temporal coding model of a neuron as
                  a communication channel assumes the output is $\tau$
                  where $\tau$ is a gamma-distributed random variable
                  corresponding to the inter-spike interval, that is,
                  the time it takes for the neuron to fire once. The
                  rate coding model is similar; the output is the
                  actual rate of firing over a fixed period of
                  time. We prove that for both models, the capacity
                  achieving distribution has only a finite number of
                  probability mass points. This allows us to compute
                  numerically the capacity of a neuron. Our capacity
                  results are in a plausible range based on biological
                  evidence to date.",
