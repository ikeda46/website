abstract: We propose a simple model of a learning machine that evolves. When a classification
  problem is given, a Perceptron like learning machine obtains a proper set of feature
  detecting cells through mating, mutation, and natural selection. Computer simulation
  showed the expected results. This is one of our trials to  approach the evolutionary
  system in the real world.
