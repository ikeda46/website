 abstract = {We propose a simple model of a learning machine that
evolves. When a classification problem is given, a
Perceptron like learning machine obtains a proper set
of feature detecting cells through mating, mutation,
and natural selection. Computer simulation showed the
expected results. This is one of our trials to 
approach the evolutionary system in the real world.},
