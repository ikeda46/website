 abstract = {We report observations of a stellar occultation by
the classical Kuiper Belt object (50000) Quaoar that
occurred on 2019 June 28. A single-chord
high-cadence (2Hz) photometry data set was obtained
with the Tomo-e Gozen CMOS camera mounted on the
1.05 m Schmidt telescope at Kiso Observatory. The
obtained ingress and egress data do not show any
indication of atmospheric refraction and allow new
1$σ$ and 3$σ$ upper limits of 6 and 16
nbar, respectively, to be set for the surface
pressure of a pure methane atmosphere. These upper
limits are lower than the saturation vapor pressure
of methane at Quaoar's expected mean surface
temperature (T$∼$44 K) and imply the absence of
a$∼$10 nbar-level global atmosphere formed by methane
ice on Quaoar's surface.},
