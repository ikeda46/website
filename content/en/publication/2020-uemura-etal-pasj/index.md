abstract: Blazars can be divided into two subtypes, flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs)
  and BL Lac objects, which have been distinguished phenomenologically by the strength
  of their optical emission lines, while their physical nature and relationship are
  still not fully understood. In this paper, we focus on the differences in their
  variability. We characterize the blazar variability using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
  (OU) process, and investigate the features that are discriminative for the two subtypes.
  We used optical photometric and polarimetric data obtained with the 1.5-m Kanata
  telescope for 2008-2014. We found that four features, namely the variation amplitude,
  characteristic timescale, and non-stationarity of the variability obtained from
  the light curves and the median of the degree of polarization (PD), are essential
  for distinguishing between FSRQs and BL Lac objects. FSRQs are characterized by
  rare and large flares, while the variability of BL Lac objects can be reproduced
  with a stationary OU process with relatively small amplitudes. The characteristics
  of the variability are governed not by the differences in the jet structure between
  the subtypes, but by the peak frequency of the synchrotron emission. This implies
  that the nature of the variation in the jets is common in FSRQs and BL Lac objects.
  We found that BL Lac objects tend to have high PD medians, which suggests that they
  have a stable polarization component. FSRQs have no such component, possibly because
  of a strong Compton cooling effect in sub-pc scale jets.
