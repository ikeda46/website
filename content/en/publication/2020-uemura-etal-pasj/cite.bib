 abstract = {Blazars can be divided into two subtypes, flat
spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lac objects,
which have been distinguished phenomenologically by
the strength of their optical emission lines, while
their physical nature and relationship are still not
fully understood. In this paper, we focus on the
differences in their variability. We characterize
the blazar variability using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
(OU) process, and investigate the features that are
discriminative for the two subtypes. We used optical
photometric and polarimetric data obtained with the
1.5-m Kanata telescope for 2008-2014. We found that
four features, namely the variation amplitude,
characteristic timescale, and non-stationarity of
the variability obtained from the light curves and
the median of the degree of polarization (PD), are
essential for distinguishing between FSRQs and BL
Lac objects. FSRQs are characterized by rare and
large flares, while the variability of BL Lac
objects can be reproduced with a stationary OU
process with relatively small amplitudes. The
characteristics of the variability are governed not
by the differences in the jet structure between the
subtypes, but by the peak frequency of the
synchrotron emission. This implies that the nature
of the variation in the jets is common in FSRQs and
BL Lac objects. We found that BL Lac objects tend to
have high PD medians, which suggests that they have
a stable polarization component. FSRQs have no such
component, possibly because of a strong Compton
cooling effect in sub-pc scale jets.},
