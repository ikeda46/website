abstract: 'In this paper, we propose the SPR (sparse phase retrieval) method, which
is a new phase retrieval method for coherent x-ray diffraction imaging (CXDI). Conventional
phase retrieval methods effectively solve the problem for high signal-to-noise ratio
measurements, but would not be sufficient for single biomolecular imaging which
is expected to be realized with femto-second x-ray free electron laser pulses. The
SPR method is based on the Bayesian statistics. It does not need to set the object
boundary constraint that is required by the commonly used hybrid input-output (HIO)
method, instead a prior distribution is defined with an exponential distribution
and used for the estimation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
reconstructs the electron density under a noisy condition even some central pixels
are masked.'
