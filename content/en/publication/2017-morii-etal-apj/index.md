abstract: Optical wide-field surveys with a high cadence are expected to create a
  new field of astronomy, so-called ``movie astronomy,'' in the near future. The amount
  of data from the observations will be huge, and hence efficient data compression
  will be indispensable. Here we propose a low-rank matrix approximation with sparse
  matrix decomposition as a promising solution to reduce the data size effectively
  while preserving sufficient scientific information. We apply one of the methods
  to the movie data obtained with the prototype model of the Tomo-e Gozen mounted
  on the 1.0 m Schmidt telescope of Kiso Observatory. Once full-scale observation
  with the Tomo-e Gozen commences, it will generate ~30 TB of data per night. We demonstrate
  that the data are compressed by a factor of about 10 in size without losing transient
  events like optical short transient point sources and meteors. The intensity of
  point sources can be recovered from the compressed data. The processing runs sufficiently
  fast, compared with the expected data-acquisition rate in the actual observing runs.
