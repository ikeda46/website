 abstract = {Optical wide-field surveys with a high cadence are
expected to create a new field of astronomy,
so-called ``movie astronomy,'' in the near
future. The amount of data from the observations
will be huge, and hence efficient data compression
will be indispensable. Here we propose a low-rank
matrix approximation with sparse matrix
decomposition as a promising solution to reduce the
data size effectively while preserving sufficient
scientific information. We apply one of the methods
to the movie data obtained with the prototype model
of the Tomo-e Gozen mounted on the 1.0 m Schmidt
telescope of Kiso Observatory. Once full-scale
observation with the Tomo-e Gozen commences, it will
generate ~30 TB of data per night. We demonstrate
that the data are compressed by a factor of about 10
in size without losing transient events like optical
short transient point sources and meteors. The
intensity of point sources can be recovered from the
compressed data. The processing runs sufficiently
fast, compared with the expected data-acquisition
rate in the actual observing runs.},
