 abstract = {For studying the mechanism of the brain, so called
``synthetic approach'' is effective. Synthetic approach 
is to conjecture the mechanism of the target through 
constructing its model. We have constructed some twenty 
models of the brain for this study. In this article, we 
describe one of them which we constructed recently. The 
model includes abilities of perception, memory, and 
action. To have these three abilities enables the model 
to realize highly intellectual behavior or 
self-organizing ability that cannot be realized by a 
model having just one ability. We realized the model in 
the form of a robot which organizes purposive behavior 
by itself. This robot forms effective behavioral 
patterns to achieve the purpose through trial and 
error.},
