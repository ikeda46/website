abstract: For studying the mechanism of the brain, so called ``synthetic approach''
  is effective. Synthetic approach  is to conjecture the mechanism of the target through  constructing
  its model. We have constructed some twenty  models of the brain for this study.
  In this article, we  describe one of them which we constructed recently. The  model
  includes abilities of perception, memory, and  action. To have these three abilities
  enables the model  to realize highly intellectual behavior or  self-organizing ability
  that cannot be realized by a  model having just one ability. We realized the model
  in  the form of a robot which organizes purposive behavior  by itself. This robot
  forms effective behavioral  patterns to achieve the purpose through trial and  error.
