 abstract = {The W-S (Wake-Sleep) algorithm is a simple learning rule
for the models with hidden variables. It is shown that 
this algorithm can be applied to a factor analysis model
which is a linear version of the Helmholtz machine. 
But even for a factor analysis model, the general
convergence is not proved theoretically. In this 
article, we describe the geometrical understanding 
of the W-S algorithm in contrast with the EM 
(Expectation-Maximization) algorithm and the em 
algorithm. As the result, we prove the convergence 
of the W-S algorithm for the factor analysis model. 
We also show the condition for the convergence in 
general models.},
