abstract: 'We propose a new imaging technique for interferometry using sparse modeling,
  utilizing two regularization terms: the $ell_1$-norm and a new function named total
  squared variation (TSV) of the brightness distribution. First, we demonstrate that
  our technique may achieve a superresolution of $∼30%$ compared with the traditional
  CLEAN beam size using synthetic observations of two point sources. Second, we present
  simulated observations of three physically motivated static models of Sgr A$^*$
  with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) to show the performance of proposed techniques
  in greater detail. Remarkably, in both the image and gradient domains, the optimal
  beam size minimizing root-mean-squared errors is $łe 10%$ of the traditional CLEAN
  beam size for $ell_1+$ TSV regularization, and non-convolved reconstructed images
  have smaller errors than beam-convolved reconstructed images. This indicates that
  TSV is well matched to the expected physical properties of the astronomical images
  and the traditional post-processing technique of Gaussian convolution in interferometric
  imaging may not be required. We also propose a feature-extraction method to detect
  circular features from the image of a black hole shadow and use it to evaluate the
  performance of the image reconstruction. With this method and reconstructed images,
  the EHT can constrain the radius of the black hole shadow with an accuracy of $∼10%
  - 20%$ in present simulations for Sgr A$^*$, suggesting that the EHT would be able
  to provide useful independent measurements of the mass of the supermassive black
  holes in Sgr A$^*$ and also another primary target, M87.'
