 abstract = {We propose a new imaging technique for
interferometry using sparse modeling, utilizing two
regularization terms: the $\ell_1$-norm and a new
function named total squared variation (TSV) of the
brightness distribution. First, we demonstrate that
our technique may achieve a superresolution of
$∼30%$ compared with the traditional CLEAN beam
size using synthetic observations of two point
sources. Second, we present simulated observations
of three physically motivated static models of Sgr
A$^*$ with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) to
show the performance of proposed techniques in
greater detail. Remarkably, in both the image and
gradient domains, the optimal beam size minimizing
root-mean-squared errors is $łe 10%$ of the
traditional CLEAN beam size for $\ell_1+$ TSV
regularization, and non-convolved reconstructed
images have smaller errors than beam-convolved
reconstructed images. This indicates that TSV is
well matched to the expected physical properties of
the astronomical images and the traditional
post-processing technique of Gaussian convolution in
interferometric imaging may not be required. We also
propose a feature-extraction method to detect
circular features from the image of a black hole
shadow and use it to evaluate the performance of the
image reconstruction. With this method and
reconstructed images, the EHT can constrain the
radius of the black hole shadow with an accuracy of
$∼10% - 20%$ in present simulations for Sgr
A$^*$, suggesting that the EHT would be able to
provide useful independent measurements of the mass
of the supermassive black holes in Sgr A$^*$ and
also another primary target, M87.},
