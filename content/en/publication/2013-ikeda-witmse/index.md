abstract: Since Shannon's seminal work, channel capacity has been a fundamental
  quantity in information thoery. The general definition is formulated as an
  optimization problem of a probability measure under some moment constraints.
  Similarly, the definition of rate-distortion function is formulated as a
  probability measure optimization problem. We have observed that the optimal
  measure becomes discrete even if continuous measures are allowed. The same
  phenomena are observed in Bayesian statistics, where the channel capacity
  problem is deeply related to the reference prior. In this talk, the background
  of the problem is introduced with some examples, and its applications to
  communication theory is discussed.
