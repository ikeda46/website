 abstract = {We propose a deep-learning approach based on
generative adversarial networks (GANs) to reduce
noise in weak lensing mass maps under realistic
conditions. We apply image-to-image translation
using conditional GANs to the mass map obtained
from the first-year data of Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam
(HSC) survey. We train the conditional GANs by
using 25000 mock HSC catalogues that directly
incorporate a variety of observational effects. We
study the non-Gaussian information in denoised maps
using one-point probability distribution functions
(PDFs) and also perform matching analysis for
positive peaks and massive clusters. An ensemble
learning technique with our GANs is successfully
applied to reproduce the PDFs of the lensing
convergence. About $60%$ of
the peaks in the denoised maps with height greater
than 5$σ$ have counterparts of massive clusters
within a separation of 6 arcmin. We show that PDFs
in the denoised maps are not compromised by details
of multiplicative biases and photometric redshift
distributions, nor by shape measurement errors, and
that the PDFs show stronger cosmological
dependence compared to the noisy counterpart. We
apply our denoising method to a part of the
first-year HSC data to show that the observed mass
distribution is statistically consistent with the
prediction from the standard $Łambda$CDM model.},
