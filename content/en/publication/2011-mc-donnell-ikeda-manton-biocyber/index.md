abstract: 'This article introduces several fundamental concepts in information theory
  from the perspective of their origins in engineering. Understanding such concepts
  is important in neuroscience for two reasons. Simply applying formulae from information
  theory without understanding the assumptions behind their definitions can lead to
  erroneous results and conclusions. Furthermore, this century will see a convergence
  of information theory and neuroscience; information theory will expand its foundations
  to incorporate more comprehensively biological processes thereby helping reveal
  how neuronal networks achieve their remarkable information processing abilities.'
