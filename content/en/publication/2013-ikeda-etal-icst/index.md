abstract: 'The goal of the Compton camera imaging is to visualize the gamma-ray
intensity map. Here, we focus on the case where the gamma-ray sources are
sufficiently far from the camera and propose a new reconstruction method for the
Compton camera imaging. The method is called the bin-mode estimation (BME). The
assumption is valid for astronomy applications. The method can be implemented
easily, and numerical simulations show the proposed method provides sharp
reconstructions.'
