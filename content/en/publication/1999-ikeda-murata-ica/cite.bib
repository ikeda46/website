 abstract = {We propose a method of ICA for separating convolutive
mixtures of acoustic signals. The acoustic signals 
recorded in a real environment are not instantaneous 
but convolutive mixtures, because of the delay and the
reflections. In order to separate these signals, it is 
effective to transform the signals into time-frequency 
domain. The difficult point in these approaches is the
ambiguity of the permutation and amplitude which is
unavoidable in original ICA problem. Since the basic 
ICA approaches cannot solve these ambiguity, we need 
another approach to solve them. We employed the 
envelopes of the signals to solve it, and have 
developed some algorithms. In this article, we show 
the outline of our orignal method, and some extensions 
of it. They are, the on-line version and auditory 
scene analysis problem.},
