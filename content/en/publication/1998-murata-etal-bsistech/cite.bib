 abstract = {In this paper we introduce a new technique for blind 
source separation of speech signals. We focus on the
temporal structure of the signals in contrast to most 
other major approaches to this problem. The idea is to 
apply the decorrelation method proposed by Molgedey 
and Schuster in the time-frequency domain. We show 
some results of experiments with both artificially
controlled data and speech data recorded in the real
environment.},
