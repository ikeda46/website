abstract: 'Recent computational studies have succeeded in presenting trajectory planning algorithms which could well replicate human movements. However, most of them have not explicitly clarified the problem of motor command representation. The authors recently proposed a novel motor planning algorithm based on &quot;sparse representation,&quot; which tries to design motor commands with combination of a smaller number of basis patterns. This paper presents a generalized formulation of this framework.'
