abstract: 'We propose a new type of kernel function, where feature space is explicitly given with a piece-wise linear mapping from the input space. This idea is inspired by sparse linear system analysis, where inputs are represented as a sparse linear combination of &quot;dictionary vectors.&quot; This article gives the idea of such kernel function, and some preliminary experimental results.'
