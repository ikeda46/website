abstract: 'This article proposes a new method to improve the reception of the digital satellite broadcasting on a moving vehicle. There are two major factors which make the reception difficult, the Doppler shift and the fading channel. The proposed method does not rely on any diversity receptions nor pilot sequences but uses the channel estimation and stochastic inference. First, Doppler shift is estimated and removed. Then the fading channel is represented with a graphical model, and the parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood estimation. The inference of the code words based on the graphical model is computed and used for decoding. We confirmed the improvements through experiments with numerical simulations and real data. Computational cost is reasonable for real time system and the results are promising.'
