abstract: When surrounded by a transparent emission region, black holes are expected
  to reveal a dark shadow caused by gravitational light bending and photon capture
  at the event horizon. To image and study this phenomenon, we have assembled the
  Event Horizon Telescope, a global very long baseline interferometry array observing
  at a wavelength of $1.3$ mm. This allows us to reconstruct event-horizon-scale images
  of the supermassive black hole candidate in the center of the giant elliptical galaxy
  M87. We have resolved the central compact radio source as an asymmetric bright emission
  ring with a diameter of $42\pm 3$ micro-as, which is circular and encompasses a central
  depression in brightness with a flux ratio $\ge$ 10:1. The
  emission ring is recovered using different calibration and imaging schemes, with
  its diameter and width remaining stable over four different observations carried
  out in different days. Overall, the observed image is consistent with expectations
  for the shadow of a Kerr black hole as predicted by general relativity. The asymmetry
  in brightness in the ring can be explained in terms of relativistic beaming of the
  emission from a plasma rotating close to the speed of light around a black hole.
  We compare our images to an extensive library of ray-traced general-relativistic
  magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black holes and derive a central mass of $M =
  (6.5\pm 0.7) \times 10^9$ $M_\odot$. Our radio-wave observations thus provide powerful
  evidence for the presence of supermassive black holes in centers of galaxies and
  as the central engines of active galactic nuclei. They also present a new tool to
  explore gravity in its most extreme limit and on a mass scale that was so far not
  accessible.
