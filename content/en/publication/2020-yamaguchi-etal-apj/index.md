abstract: 'With an emphasis on improving the fidelity even in super-resolution regimes,
  new imaging techniques have been intensively developed over the last several years,
  which may provide substantial improvements to the interferometric observation of
  protoplanetary disks. In this study, sparse modeling (SpM) is applied for the first
  time to observational data sets taken by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
  Array (ALMA). The two data sets used in this study were taken independently using
  different array configurations at Band 7 (330 GHz), targeting the protoplanetary
  disk around HD 142527: one in the shorter-baseline array configuration ($\sim$430 m),
  and the other in the longer-baseline array configuration ($\sim$1570 m). The image
  resolutions reconstructed from the two data sets are different by a factor of $\sim$3.
  We confirm that the previously known disk structures appear on the images produced
  by both SpM and CLEAN at the standard beam size. The image reconstructed from the
  shorter-baseline data using the SpM matches that obtained with the longer-baseline
  data using the CLEAN, achieving a super-resolution image from which a structure
  finer than the beam size can be reproduced. Our results demonstrate that ongoing
  intensive development in the SpM imaging technique is beneficial to imaging with
  ALMA.'
