 abstract = {With an emphasis on improving the fidelity even in
super-resolution regimes, new imaging techniques
have been intensively developed over the last
several years, which may provide substantial
improvements to the interferometric observation of
protoplanetary disks. In this study, sparse modeling
(SpM) is applied for the first time to observational
data sets taken by the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The two data
sets used in this study were taken independently
using different array configurations at Band 7 (330
GHz), targeting the protoplanetary disk around HD
142527: one in the shorter-baseline array
configuration ($∼$430 m), and the other in the
longer-baseline array configuration ($∼$1570 m). The
image resolutions reconstructed from the two data
sets are different by a factor of $∼$3. We confirm
that the previously known disk structures appear on
the images produced by both SpM and CLEAN at the
standard beam size. The image reconstructed from the
shorter-baseline data using the SpM matches that
obtained with the longer-baseline data using the
CLEAN, achieving a super-resolution image from which
a structure finer than the beam size can be
reproduced. Our results demonstrate that ongoing
intensive development in the SpM imaging technique
is beneficial to imaging with ALMA.},
