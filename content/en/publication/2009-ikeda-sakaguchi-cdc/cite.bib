 abstract = {A fundamental problem in the field of motor
neuroscience is to understand how our brain
generates appropriate motor commands for precise
movements effortlessly. The problem seems difficult
since there are infinitely many possible
trajectories and our musculo-skeltal system is
generally redundant. We focus on the motor command
representation and show that a simple strategy can
solve the problem for a planar two-joints arm
model. We also discuss the emergence of the muscle
synergies, which may enable us to make natural motor
behaviors with smaller degrees of freedom.},
