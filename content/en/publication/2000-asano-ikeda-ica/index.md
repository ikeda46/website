abstract: Blind source separation based on the time-delayed decorrelation, which had
  been extended to a convolved mixture problem, is evaluated and implemented in a
  DSP system. The evalutation is conducted using the data recorded in an anechoic
  chamber and those in a listening room with moderate reverberation. The crosstalks
  and the scores of automatic speech recognition are measured. The hardware consists
  of dual DSPs and a host PC. The results of the benchmark is shown.
