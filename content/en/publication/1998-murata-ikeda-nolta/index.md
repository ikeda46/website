abstract: In this article, we propose an on-line algorithm for  Blind Source Separation
  of speech signals, which is  recorded in a real environment. This on-line algorithm  makes it possible to trace the changing environment.  The idea is to apply some on-line algorithm in the time-frequency domain. We show some results of  experiments.
