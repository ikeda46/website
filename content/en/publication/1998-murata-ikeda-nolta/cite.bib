 abstract = {In this article, we propose an on-line algorithm for 
Blind Source Separation of speech signals, which is 
recorded in a real environment. This on-line algorithm 
makes it possible to trace the changing environment. 
The idea is to apply some on-line algorithm in the
time-frequency domain. We show some results of 
experiments.},
