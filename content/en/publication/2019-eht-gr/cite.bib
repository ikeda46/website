 bbstract = {Recent developments in compact object astrophysics,
especially the discovery of merging neutron stars by
LIGO, the imaging of the black hole in M87 by the
Event Horizon Telescope, and high- precision
astrometry of the Galactic Center at close to the
event horizon scale by the GRAVITY experiment
motivate the development of numerical source models
that solve the equations of general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD). Here we compare GRMHD
solutions for the evolution of a magnetized
accretion flow where turbulence is promoted by the
magnetorotational instability from a set of nine
GRMHD codes: Athena++, BHAC, Cosmos++, ECHO, H-AMR,
iharm3D, HARM-Noble, IllinoisGRMHD, and
KORAL. Agreement among the codes improves as
resolution increases, as measured by a consistently
applied, specially developed set of code performance
metrics. We conclude that the community of GRMHD
codes is mature, capable, and consistent on these
test problems.},
