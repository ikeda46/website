 abstract = {Spatial correlations among protoplanetary disk
orientations carry unique information on physics of
multiple-star formation processes. We select five
nearby star-forming regions that comprise a number
of protoplanetary disks with spatially resolved
images with ALMA and Hubble Space Telescope, and we
search for the mutual alignment of the disk
axes. Specifically, we apply the Kuiper test to
examine the statistical uniformity of the position
angle (PA: the angle of the major axis of the
projected disk ellipse measured counterclockwise
from the north) distribution. The disks located in
the star-forming regions, except the Lupus clouds,
do not show any signature of the alignment,
supporting the random orientation. Rotational axes
of 16 disks with spectroscopic measurement of PA in
the Lupus III cloud, a subregion of the Lupus field,
however, exhibit a weak and possible departure from
the random distribution at a 2$σ$ level, and
the inclination angles of the 16 disks are not
uniform as well. Furthermore, the mean direction of
the disk PAs in the Lupus III cloud is parallel to
the direction of its filament structure and
approximately perpendicular to the magnetic field
direction. We also confirm the robustness of the
estimated PAs in the Lupus clouds by comparing the
different observations and estimators based on three
different methods, including sparse modeling. The
absence of the significant alignment of the disk
orientation is consistent with the turbulent origin
of the disk angular momentum. Further observations
are required to confirm/falsify the possible disk
alignment in the Lupus III cloud.},
