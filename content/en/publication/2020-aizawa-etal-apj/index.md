abstract: 'Spatial correlations among protoplanetary disk orientations carry unique
  information on physics of multiple-star formation processes. We select five nearby
  star-forming regions that comprise a number of protoplanetary disks with spatially
  resolved images with ALMA and Hubble Space Telescope, and we search for the mutual
  alignment of the disk axes. Specifically, we apply the Kuiper test to examine the
  statistical uniformity of the position angle (PA: the angle of the major axis of
  the projected disk ellipse measured counterclockwise from the north) distribution.
  The disks located in the star-forming regions, except the Lupus clouds, do not show
  any signature of the alignment, supporting the random orientation. Rotational axes
  of 16 disks with spectroscopic measurement of PA in the Lupus III cloud, a subregion
  of the Lupus field, however, exhibit a weak and possible departure from the random
  distribution at a 2$\sigma$ level, and the inclination angles of the 16 disks are not
  uniform as well. Furthermore, the mean direction of the disk PAs in the Lupus III
  cloud is parallel to the direction of its filament structure and approximately perpendicular
  to the magnetic field direction. We also confirm the robustness of the estimated
  PAs in the Lupus clouds by comparing the different observations and estimators based
  on three different methods, including sparse modeling. The absence of the significant
  alignment of the disk orientation is consistent with the turbulent origin of the
  disk angular momentum. Further observations are required to confirm/falsify the
  possible disk alignment in the Lupus III cloud.'
