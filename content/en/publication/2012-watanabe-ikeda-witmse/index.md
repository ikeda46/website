abstract: We discuss a nonparametric estimation method of the mixing
  distribution in mixture models. We propose an objective function with one
  parameter, where its minimization becomes the maximum likelihood estimation or
  the kernel vector quantization in special cases. Generalizing Lindsay's
  theorem for the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation, we prove the
  existence and discreteness of the optimal mixing distribution and devise an
  algorithm to calculate it. Furthermore, we show the connection between the
  unifying estimation framework and the rate-distortion problem. It is
  demonstrated that with an appropriate choice of the parameter, the proposed
  method is less prone to overfitting than the maximum likelihood method.
