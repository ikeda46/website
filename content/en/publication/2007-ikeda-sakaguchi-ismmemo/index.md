abstract: 'The fundamental problem of the motor neuroscience is to understand how humans make precise movements effortlessly. The problem seems difficult since there are infinite possible trajectories and the muscles are generally redundant. We discuss the problem from the viewpoint of motor command representation and show that a simple strategy can solve the problem with a two joints arm model. We also discuss the emergence of the muscle synergies, which may enable us to make natural motor behaviors with small degrees of freedom.'
