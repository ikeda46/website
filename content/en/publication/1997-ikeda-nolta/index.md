abstract: The EM algorithm is widely used to estimate the  parameters of many applications.
  It is simple but the convergence speed is slow. There is another algorithm  called
  the scoring method which is faster but  complicated. We show these two methods can
  be  connected by using the EM algorithm recursively.
