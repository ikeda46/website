 abstract = {The EM algorithm is widely used to estimate the 
parameters of many applications. It is simple but the
convergence speed is slow. There is another algorithm 
called the scoring method which is faster but 
complicated. We show these two methods can be 
connected by using the EM algorithm recursively.},
