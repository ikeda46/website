abstract: In this article, we propose an Blind Source Separation algorithm for convolutive mixture of signals. We propose a method of separating signals in the time-frequency domain. We apply the decorrelation method proposed by Molgedey and Schuster on spectrogram and reconstruct separated signals focusing on the temporal structure of  the signals. We show some results of experiments with  both artificially controlled data and speech data  recorded in the real environment.
