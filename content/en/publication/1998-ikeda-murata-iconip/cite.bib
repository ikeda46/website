 abstract = {In this article, we propose an Blind Source Separation
algorithm for convolutive mixture of signals. We propose
a method of separating signals in the time-frequency 
domain. We apply the decorrelation method proposed by
Molgedey and Schuster on spectrogram and reconstruct
separated signals focusing on the temporal structure of 
the signals. We show some results of experiments with 
both artificially controlled data and speech data 
recorded in the real environment.},
