abstract: For the study of evolutionary systems, we have already proposed several
  models. In this paper, we are concerned with a different type of evolutionary system,
  the cell-specialization. As seen in hydras,  cell-specialization is one of the very
  important types  of self-organization. In the process of  cell-specialization, each
  cell which has the same DNA  is specialized. The whole system which consists of  these
  cells has a highly advanced function. We propose  a kind of coding (something like
  DNA), ``a system description'' which makes this possible. Using the  system description,
  we built a hardware model which  shows the validity for self-organization, and also
  did  some computer simulations which shows this can be used  for evolutionary systems.
