 abstract = {For the study of evolutionary systems, we have already
proposed several models. In this paper, we are concerned
with a different type of evolutionary system, the
cell-specialization. As seen in hydras, 
cell-specialization is one of the very important types 
of self-organization. In the process of 
cell-specialization, each cell which has the same DNA 
is specialized. The whole system which consists of 
these cells has a highly advanced function. We propose 
a kind of coding (something like DNA), ``a system description'' which makes this possible. Using the 
system description, we built a hardware model which 
shows the validity for self-organization, and also did 
some computer simulations which shows this can be used 
for evolutionary systems.},
