abstract: We present measurements of the properties of the central radio source in
  M87 using Event Horizon Telescope data obtained during the 2017 campaign. We develop
  and fit geometric crescent models (asymmetric rings with interior brightness depressions)
  using two independent sampling algorithms that consider distinct representations
  of the visibility data. We show that the crescent family of models is statistically
  preferred over other comparably complex geometric models that we explore. We calibrate
  the geometric model parameters using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD)
  models of the emission region and estimate physical properties of the source. We
  further fit images generated from GRMHD models directly to the data. We compare
  the derived emission region and black hole parameters from these analyses with those
  recovered from reconstructed images. There is a remarkable consistency among all
  methods and data sets. We find that $>50$\% of the total flux at arcsecond scales
  comes from near the horizon, and that the emission is dramatically suppressed interior
  to this region by a factor $>$10, providing direct evidence of the predicted shadow
  of a black hole. Across all methods, we measure a crescent diameter of $42 \pm 3$
  $\mu$as and constrain its fractional width to be $< 0.5$. Associating the crescent
  feature with the emission surrounding the black hole shadow, we infer an angular
  gravitational radius of $GM/Dc^2 = 3.8 \pm 0.4$ $\mu$as. Folding in a distance measurement
  of $16.8_{-0.7}^{+0.8},\mathrm{Mpc}$ gives a black hole mass of $M=6.5\pm 0.2|_{\mathrm{stat}} \pm
  0.7|_{\mathrm{sys}} \times 10^9 M_\odot$. This measurement from lensed emission
  near the event horizon is consistent with the presence of a central Kerr black hole,
  as predicted by the general theory of relativity.
