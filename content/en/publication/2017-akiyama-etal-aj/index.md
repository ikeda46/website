abstract: 'We propose a new technique for radio interferometry to obtain
  superresolution full-polarization images in all four Stokes parameters using
  sparse modeling. The proposed technique reconstructs the image in each Stokes
  parameter from the corresponding full-complex Stokes visibilities by
  utilizing two regularization functions: the ℓ1 norm and the total variation
  (TV) of the brightness distribution. As an application of this technique, we
  present simulated linear polarization observations of two physically
  motivated models of M87 with the Event Horizon Telescope. We confirm that
  $\ell_1$+TV regularization can achieve an optimal resolution of $\sim$25%-30%
  of the diffraction limit $\lambda/{D}_{\max}$, which is the nominal spatial
  resolution of a radio interferometer for both the total intensity (i.e.,
  Stokes $I$) and linear polarizations (i.e., Stokes $Q$ and $U$). This optimal
  resolution is better than that obtained from the widely used Cotton–Schwab
  CLEAN algorithm or from using $\ell_1$ or TV regularizations alone.
  Furthermore, we find that $\ell_1$+TV regularization can achieve much better
  image fidelity in linear polarization than other techniques over a wide range
  of spatial scales, not only in the superresolution regime, but also on scales
  larger than the diffraction limit. Our results clearly demonstrate that
  sparse reconstruction is a useful choice for high-fidelity full-polarimetric
  interferometric imaging.'
