 abstract = {In order to categorize a set of data which consists
of some categories, it is important to know the
probability distribution of the data of each category.
Using these probability distributions, one can 
classify the data. In most cases, such as speech and
image recognition problems, the data, for training 
are categorized in advance. But there are some cases
when only the uncategorized data are available. For
example, when a baby learns phonation, it is hard to
give it the samples of each phone separately, it 
learns the number of the phones and how to phonate 
each of them through observing only the uncategorized
data and making communication with the parents or the
teacher. In this article, the authors give an 
algorithm for this situation. In the algorithm, the
distribution of whole data is described with a 
finite mixture model. The model can observe only 
the uncategorized data but can make a kind of
communication with the teacher (which is the 
probability source). The parameters of the model 
are estimated using the EM algorithm and the number 
of the categories are determined through a 
communication with the teacher. A numerical 
simulation of a simple image recognition problem is
given.},
