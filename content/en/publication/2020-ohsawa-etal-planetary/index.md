abstract: Radar and optical simultaneous observations of meteors are important to
  understand the size distribution of the interplanetary dust. However, faint meteors
  detected by high power large aperture radar observations, which are typically as
  faint as 10 mag. In optical, have not been detected until recently in optical observations,
  mainly due to insufficient sensitivity of the optical observations. In this paper,
  two radar and optical simultaneous observations were organized. The first observation
  was carried out in 2009-2010 using Middle and Upper Atmosphere Radar (MU radar)
  and an image-intensified CCD camera. The second observation was carried out in 2018
  using the MU radar and a mosaic CMOS camera, Tomo-e Gozen, mounted on the 1.05 m
  Kiso Schmidt Telescope. In total, 331 simultaneous meteors were detected. The relationship
  between radar cross sections and optical V-band magnitudes was well approximated
  by a linear function. A transformation function from the radar cross section to
  the V-band magnitude was derived for sporadic meteors. The transformation function
  was applied to about 150,000 meteors detected by the MU radar in 2009-2015, large
  part of which are sporadic, and a luminosity function was derived in the magnitude
  range of -1.5--9.5mag . The luminosity function was well approximated by a single
  power-law function with the population index of $r=3.52\pm 0.12$. The present observation
  indicates that the MU radar has capability to detect interplanetary dust of $10^{-5}$
  -- $10^0$g in mass as meteors.
