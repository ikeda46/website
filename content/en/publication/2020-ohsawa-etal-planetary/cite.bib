 abstract = {Radar and optical simultaneous observations of
meteors are important to understand the size
distribution of the interplanetary dust. However,
faint meteors detected by high power large aperture
radar observations, which are typically as faint as
10 mag. In optical, have not been detected until
recently in optical observations, mainly due to
insufficient sensitivity of the optical
observations. In this paper, two radar and optical
simultaneous observations were organized. The first
observation was carried out in 2009-2010 using
Middle and Upper Atmosphere Radar (MU radar) and an
image-intensified CCD camera. The second observation
was carried out in 2018 using the MU radar and a
mosaic CMOS camera, Tomo-e Gozen, mounted on the
1.05-m Kiso Schmidt Telescope. In total, 331
simultaneous meteors were detected. The relationship
between radar cross sections and optical V-band
magnitudes was well approximated by a linear
function. A transformation function from the radar
cross section to the V-band magnitude was derived
for sporadic meteors. The transformation function
was applied to about 150,000 meteors detected by the
MU radar in 2009-2015, large part of which are
sporadic, and a luminosity function was derived in
the magnitude range of -1.5--9.5mag . The luminosity
function was well approximated by a single power-law
function with the population index of
$r=3.52Â± 0.12$. The present observation indicates that
the MU radar has capability to detect interplanetary
dust of $10^-5$ -- $10^0$g in mass as meteors.},
