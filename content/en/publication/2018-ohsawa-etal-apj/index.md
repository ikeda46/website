abstract: Chopping observations with a tip-tilt secondary mirror have conventionally
  been used in ground-based mid-infrared observations. However, it is not practical
  for next generation large telescopes to have a large tip-tilt mirror that moves
  at a frequency larger than a few hertz. We propose an alternative observing method,
  a "slow-scanning" observation. Images are continuously captured as movie data,
  while the field of view is slowly moved. The signal from an astronomical object
  is extracted from the movie data by a low-rank and sparse matrix decomposition.
  The performance of the "slow-scanning" observation was tested in an experimental
  observation with Subaru/COMICS. The quality of a resultant image in the "slow-scanning"
  observation was as good as in a conventional chopping observation with COMICS, at
  least for a bright point-source object. The observational efficiency in the "slow-scanning"
  observation was better than that in the chopping observation. The results suggest
  that the "slow-scanning" observation can be a competitive method for the Subaru
  telescope and be of potential interest to other ground-based facilities to avoid
  chopping.
