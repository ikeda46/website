 abstract = {Chopping observations with a tip-tilt secondary
mirror have conventionally been used in ground-based
mid-infrared observations. However, it is not
practical for next generation large telescopes to
have a large tip-tilt mirror that moves at a
frequency larger than a few hertz. We propose an
alternative observing method, a ``slow-scanning''
observation. Images are continuously captured as
movie data, while the field of view is slowly
moved. The signal from an astronomical object is
extracted from the movie data by a low-rank and
sparse matrix decomposition. The performance of the
``slow-scanning'' observation was tested in an
experimental observation with Subaru/COMICS. The
quality of a resultant image in the ``slow-scanning''
observation was as good as in a conventional
chopping observation with COMICS, at least for a
bright point-source object. The observational
efficiency in the ``slow-scanning'' observation was
better than that in the chopping observation. The
results suggest that the ``slow-scanning'' observation
can be a competitive method for the Subaru telescope
and be of potential interest to other ground-based
facilities to avoid chopping.},
