 abstract = {The author proposes an algorithm to define a structure
of a HMM (hidden Markov model). HMMs are widely 
used in the speech recognition systems and at that time
structures are usually determined according to the
heuristic knowledge. In this article this problem is
treated as so-called “model selection” problem in 
statistics. Two recognition experiments using this 
algorithm are shown. First, artificial data then, ATR
speech database are used for the source. Through these
experiments, the author shows that such model selection
is effective.},
