abstract: The author proposes an algorithm to define a structure of a HMM (hidden
  Markov model). HMMs are widely  used in the speech recognition systems and at that
  time structures are usually determined according to the heuristic knowledge. In
  this article this problem is treated as so-called “model selection” problem in  statistics.
  Two recognition experiments using this  algorithm are shown. First, artificial data
  then, ATR speech database are used for the source. Through these experiments, the
  author shows that such model selection is effective.
