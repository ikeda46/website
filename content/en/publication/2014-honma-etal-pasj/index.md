abstract: We propose a new technique to obtain super-resolution images with
  radio interferometry using sparse modeling. In standard radio interferometry,
  sampling of $(u, v)$ is quite often incomplete and thus obtaining an image
  from observed visibilities becomes an underdetermined problem, and a
  technique of so-called "zero-padding" is often used to fill up unsampled
  grids in the $(u, v)$ plane, resulting in image degradation by finite beam
  size as well as numerous side-lobes. In this paper we show that directly
  solving such an underdetermined problem based on sparse modeling (in this
  paper, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, known as LASSO)
  avoids the above problems introduced by zero-padding, leading to
  super-resolution images in which structure finer than the standard beam size
  (diffraction limit) can be reproduced. We present results of one-dimensional
  and two-dimensional simulations of interferometric imaging, and discuss its
  implications for super-resolution imaging, particularly focusing on imaging
  of black hole shadows with millimeter VLBI (Very Long Baseline
  Interferometry).
