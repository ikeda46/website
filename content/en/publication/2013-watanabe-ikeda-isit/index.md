abstract: We evaluate the rate-distortion function for the i.i.d. gamma sources
  with respect to the absolute-log distortion measure. The logarithmic
  transformation reduces this rate-distortion problem to that under the
  absolute distortion measure. Extending the explicit evaluation of the
  rate-distortion function for the Gaussian sources, we obtain the parametric
  form of the rate-distortion function. We show that the optimal distribution
  of reconstruction consists of a continuous component enclosed by left and
  right discrete components and the left discrete component vanishes when the
  allowed distortion is small.
