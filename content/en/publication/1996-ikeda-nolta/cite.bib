 abstract = {The author gives an algorithm to search the structure
of a stochastic models with hidden variable. The author 
have shown the algorithm to find the hidden structure of 
the Hidden Markov Model and in this article, the 
algorithm is applied for one of the other stochastic 
models which have hidden probabilistic variables.},
