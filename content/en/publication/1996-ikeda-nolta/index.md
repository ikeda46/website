abstract: The author gives an algorithm to search the structure of a stochastic models
  with hidden variable. The author have shown the algorithm to find the hidden structure
  of the Hidden Markov Model and in this article, the algorithm is applied for one
  of the other stochastic models which have hidden probabilistic variables.
