 abstract = {Signal overlapping is a major bottleneck for
protein NMR analysis. We propose a new method,
stable-isotope-assisted parameter extraction
(SiPex), to resolve overlapping signals by a
combination of amino-acid selective isotope labeling
(AASIL) and tensor decomposition. The basic idea of
Sipex is that overlapping signals can be decomposed
with the help of intensity patterns derived from
quantitative fractional AASIL, which also provides
amino-acid information. In SiPex, spectra for
protein characterization, such as 15N relaxation
measurements, are assembled with those for
amino-acid information to form a four-order tensor,
where the intensity patterns from AASIL contribute
to high decomposition performance even if the
signals share similar chemical shift values or
characterization profiles, such as relaxation
curves. The loading vectors of each decomposed
component, corresponding to an amide group,
represent both the amino-acid and relaxation
information. This information link provides an
alternative protein analysis method that does not
require ``assignments'' in a general sense; i.e.,
chemical shift determinations, since the amino-acid
information for some of the residues allows
unambiguous assignment according to the dual
selective labeling. SiPex can also decompose signals
in time-domain raw data without Fourier transform,
even in non-uniformly sampled data without spectral
reconstruction. These features of SiPex should
expand biological NMR applications by overcoming
their overlapping and assignment problems.},
