abstract: Signal overlapping is a major bottleneck for protein NMR analysis. We propose
  a new method, stable-isotope-assisted parameter extraction (SiPex), to resolve overlapping
  signals by a combination of amino-acid selective isotope labeling (AASIL) and tensor
  decomposition. The basic idea of Sipex is that overlapping signals can be decomposed
  with the help of intensity patterns derived from quantitative fractional AASIL,
  which also provides amino-acid information. In SiPex, spectra for protein characterization,
  such as 15N relaxation measurements, are assembled with those for amino-acid information
  to form a four-order tensor, where the intensity patterns from AASIL contribute
  to high decomposition performance even if the signals share similar chemical shift
  values or characterization profiles, such as relaxation curves. The loading vectors
  of each decomposed component, corresponding to an amide group, represent both the
  amino-acid and relaxation information. This information link provides an alternative
  protein analysis method that does not require ``assignments'' in a general sense;
  i.e., chemical shift determinations, since the amino-acid information for some of
  the residues allows unambiguous assignment according to the dual selective labeling.
  SiPex can also decompose signals in time-domain raw data without Fourier transform,
  even in non-uniformly sampled data without spectral reconstruction. These features
  of SiPex should expand biological NMR applications by overcoming their overlapping
  and assignment problems.
