abstract: 'For astronomical data analysis, there have been proposed multiple methods based on sparse modeling. We have proposed a method for Compton camera imaging. The proposed approach is a sparse modeling method, but the derived algorithm is different from LASSO. We explain the problem and how we derived the method.'
