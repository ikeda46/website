abstract: Imaging observations of faint meteors were carried out on April 11 and 14,
  2016 with a wide-field CMOS mosaic camera, Tomo-e PM, mounted on the 105-cm Schmidt
  telescope at Kiso Observatory, the University of Tokyo. Tomo-e PM, which is a prototype
  model of Tomo-e Gozen, can monitor a sky of $∼$1.98$∼$deg$^2$ at 2Hz. The numbers
  of detected meteors are 1514 and 706 on April 11 and 14, respectively. The detected
  meteors are attributed to sporadic meteors. Their absolute magnitudes range from
  +4 to +10mag in the V-band, corresponding to about $8.3times10^{-2}$ to $3.3times10^{-4}$g
  in mass. The present magnitude distributions we obtained are well explained by a
  single power-law luminosity function with a slope parameter $r=3.1\pm 0.4$ and a meteor
  rate $\log_{10}N_0=-5.5\pm 0.5$. The results demonstrate a high performance of telescopic
  observations with a wide-field video camera to constrain the luminosity function
  of faint meteors. The performance of Tomo-e Gozenis about two times higher than
  that of Tomo-e PM. A survey with Tomo-e Gozen will provide a more robust measurement
  of the luminosity function.
