 abstract = {Imaging observations of faint meteors were carried
out on April 11 and 14, 2016 with a wide-field CMOS
mosaic camera, Tomo-e PM, mounted on the 105-cm
Schmidt telescope at Kiso Observatory, the
University of Tokyo. Tomo-e PM, which is a prototype
model of Tomo-e Gozen, can monitor a sky of
$∼$1.98$∼$deg$^2$ at 2Hz. The numbers of detected
meteors are 1514 and 706 on April 11 and 14,
respectively. The detected meteors are attributed to
sporadic meteors. Their absolute magnitudes range
from +4 to +10mag in the V-band, corresponding to
about $8.3\times10^-2$ to
$3.3\times10^-4$g in mass. The present
magnitude distributions we obtained are well
explained by a single power-law luminosity function
with a slope parameter $r=3.1± 0.4$ and a meteor
rate $łog_10N0=-5.5± 0.5$. The results
demonstrate a high performance of telescopic
observations with a wide-field video camera to
constrain the luminosity function of faint
meteors. The performance of Tomo-e Gozenis about two
times higher than that of Tomo-e PM. A survey with
Tomo-e Gozenwill provide a more robust measurement
of the luminosity function.},
