abstract: In this paper we introduce a new technique for blind  source separation
  of speech signals. We focused on the temporal structure of signals which is not
  always the  case in other major approaches. The idea is to apply  the decorrelation
  method proposed by Molgedey and  Schuster in time-frequency domain. We show some
  results  of experiments with artificial data and speech data  recorded in the real
  environment. Our algorithm needs considerably straightforward calculation and includes  only a few parameters to be tuned.
