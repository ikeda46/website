 abstract = {In this paper we introduce a new technique for blind 
source separation of speech signals. We focused on the
temporal structure of signals which is not always the 
case in other major approaches. The idea is to apply 
the decorrelation method proposed by Molgedey and 
Schuster in time-frequency domain. We show some results 
of experiments with artificial data and speech data 
recorded in the real environment. Our algorithm needs
considerably straightforward calculation and includes 
only a few parameters to be tuned.},
