abstract: We propose a novel method to reconstruct high-resolution three-dimensional
  mass maps using data from photometric weak-lensing surveys. We apply an adaptive
  LASSO algorithm to perform a sparsity-based reconstruction on the assumption that
  the underlying cosmic density field is represented by a sum of Navarro–Frenk–White
  halos. We generate realistic mock galaxy shear catalogs by considering the shear
  distortions from isolated halos for the configurations matched to the Subaru Hyper
  Suprime-Cam Survey with its photometric redshift estimates. We show that the adaptive
  method significantly reduces line-of-sight smearing that is caused by the correlation
  between the lensing kernels at different redshifts. Lensing clusters with lower
  mass limits of $10^{14.0}$ $h^{−1}$ $M_\odot$, $10^{14.7}$ $h^{-1}$ $M_\odot$, $10^{15.0}$ $h^{−1}$
  $M_\odot$ can be detected with 1.5$\sigma$ confidence at the low ($z<0.3$), median ($0.3\le
  z < 0.6$), and high ($0.6 \le z < 0.85$) redshifts, respectively, with an average
  false detection rate of 0.022 deg$^{2}$. The estimated redshifts of the detected
  clusters are systematically lower than the true values by $\Delta z \sim 0.03$ for halos
  at $z \le 0.4$, but the relative redshift bias is below $0.5\%$ for clusters at $0.4
  < z \le 0.85$. The standard deviation of the redshift estimation is $0.092$. Our
  method enables direct three-dimensional cluster detection with accurate redshift
  estimates.
