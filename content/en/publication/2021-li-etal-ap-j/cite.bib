 abstract = {We propose a novel method to reconstruct high-resolution three-dimensional mass maps using data from photometric weak-lensing surveys. We apply an adaptive LASSO algorithm to perform a sparsity-based reconstruction on the assumption that the underlying cosmic density field is represented by a sum of Navarro–Frenk–White halos. We generate realistic mock galaxy shear catalogs by considering the shear distortions from isolated halos for the configurations matched to the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey with its photometric redshift estimates. We show that the adaptive method significantly reduces line-of-sight smearing that is caused by the correlation between the lensing kernels at different redshifts. Lensing clusters with lower mass limits of $10^14.0$ $h^−1$ $M_ødot$, $10^14.7$ $h^−1$ $M_ødot$, $10^15.0$ $h^−1$ $M_ødot$ can be detected with 1.5$σ$ confidence at the low ($z<0.3$), median ($0.3łe z < 0.6$), and high ($0.6 łe z < 0.85$) redshifts, respectively, with an average false detection rate of 0.022 deg$^−2$. The estimated redshifts of the detected clusters are systematically lower than the true values by $Δ z ∼ 0.03$ for halos at $z łe 0.4$, but the relative redshift bias is below $0.5%$ for clusters at $0.4 < z łe 0.85$. The standard deviation of the redshift estimation is $0.092$. Our method enables direct three-dimensional cluster detection with accurate redshift estimates.},
