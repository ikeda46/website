 abstract = {It is known that the communication channel capacity of
the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel
under peak power constraint is achieved by a
distribution, whose support is a finite isolated
points in a scalar case and is concentric circles in
a vector case. In this paper, we compare the
achievable rates of phase shift keying (PSK) and
quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) input
constellations for a complex-valued AWGN channel
with the capacity under the peak power constraint,
and compare their constellations with the
capacity-achieving distributions. The comparison
reveals that achievable rates of PSK and QAM are
close to capacities for certain ranges of signal to
noise ratio (SNR) under different forms of peak
power constraint.},
