abstract: We present a result on the local stability of the Bethe CCCP algorithm,
  proposed by Yuille as an alternative to the belief propagation for solving minimization
  problems of Bethe free energies. We first show that the Bethe CCCP algorithm can
  be interpreted within our framework, based on information geometry, to analyze the
  belief propagation and related algorithms, and then establish the local stability
  of the Bethe CCCP algorithm by showing that the Bethe CCCP algorithm is derived
  as the first-order implicit discretization scheme for the natural gradient algorithm
  to minimize Bethe free energy.
