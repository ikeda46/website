abstract: We evaluate the rate-distortion function for the i.i.d. gamma sources with
  respect to the absolute-log distortion measure. The logarithmic transformation reduces
  this rate-distortion problem to that under the absolute error criterion. Extending
  the explicit evaluation of the rate-distortion function for the Gaussian sources,
  we obtain the parametric form of the rate-distortion function. We show that the
  optimal distribution of reconstruction consists of a continuous component enclosed
  by left and right discrete components and the left discrete component vanishes when
  the allowed distortion is small.
