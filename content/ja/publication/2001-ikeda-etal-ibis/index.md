abstract: Since the turbo code was proposed early in 90’s, it is known that the turbo
  code gives a practical and powerful method for error correction. The properties
  of the code have been investigated intensively mainly through experiments. Although
  those results strongly support the high ability of the turbo code, there is no satisfactory
  theoretical results. In this paper, we elucidate the idea of turbo code through
  information geometrical viewpoint. From our study, we obtained the stability condition,
  characteristics of the equilibrium, convergence property, and approximation ability.
  Recently it is pointed out that another error correcting code, the Gallager code
  has the similar structure with the turbo code. Also Bethe  approximation in statistical
  physics, and belief propagation for Bayesian net with loops have very good similarities
  with the turbo code. Therefore, we believe our results will give a new perspective
  for these family of iterative methods.
