 abstract = {We argue the problem of determination of channel
capacity from an information geometrical view
point. Our main concern is analogue channels with
peak power constraint. It is known that the channel
capacity is typically achieved by a discrete input
distribution in such setting. In this paper, we give
an information geometrical view on such phenomena.},
