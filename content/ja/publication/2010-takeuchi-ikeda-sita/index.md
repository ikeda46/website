abstract: We argue the problem of determination of channel capacity from an information
  geometrical view point. Our main concern is analogue channels with peak power constraint.
  It is known that the channel capacity is typically achieved by a discrete input
  distribution in such setting. In this paper, we give an information geometrical
  view on such phenomena.
