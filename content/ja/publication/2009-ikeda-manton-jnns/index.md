abstract: It is widely accepted that neurons transmit information through spikes.
  Since spike timing is stochastic, neuron communication channel is noisy. And the
  capacity is one of the fundamental quantity to understand the neural information
  processing. We have computed the capacity of a single neuron for temporal and rate
  coding under natural assumption.
