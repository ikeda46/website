 abstract = {It is widely accepted that neurons transmit
information through spikes. Since spike timing is
stochastic, neuron communication channel is
noisy. And the capacity is one of the fundamental
quantity to understand the neural information
processing. We have computed the capacity of a
single neuron for temporal and rate coding under
natural assumption.},
